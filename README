# READ ME

This folder contains all the data series, r scripts, Rmarkdown and figure used
for our final submission

We currently made two pdfs for our final submission. One that contains the full
length of our code, interpretations and analysis for all our dependent variables.
This file is called Final_Project_full

We also have a more adequate length submission, where we explain the methodology
we used on a single dependent variable in a clear interpretaion of all graphs
and code used aswell as the procedure. 

We weren't sure exactly how you wanted the work so we provided both those files 
and pdf but please feel free to explore both if you feel like you want more detail

Ofcourse all the r-script files are included so they can be looked at and run.
